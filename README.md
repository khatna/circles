# circles

This is a simple project that I built using Node.JS, PaperJS and HowlerJS.
Check it out [here](http://khatna-circles.herokuapp.com).

### Description
Basically, all you have to do is press an alphabetical key on your keyboard, and some simple graphics graphics will appear on your screen, 
to go along with some cool sounds. Also, there's a lights off button, which you can click to make the background black and the circles white.
